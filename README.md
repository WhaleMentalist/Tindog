# Tindog
  Project from Udemy course that explores the Boostrap API.

  Although the course uses Bootstrap 4, I have utlized Boostrap 5 by reading the documentation and performing slight adjustments to accomodate the new features. I want to track the progress made as I advance through the module and to demonstrate basic knowledge of Bootstrap.
  
  This README will also act as my notes as I advance through the module. I want to record sources and to also preserve my thoughts.
  
  The initial project was provided by Angela Yu in 'The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp'. Although portions of the course are out od date, I simply use that as a way to improve my research and documentation reading skills. The ability to find information and to navigate documentation of frameworks is key to becoming a better software developer and it takes practice!
